The UI needs more work, but at the moment it's enough for basic functionality. 

ALert messages correctly managed for invalid Stock details/names.

A simple display of all the current data on stocks when the user types in a valid Stock Symbol. A nice and easy way for investors to constantly be up to date with the market! 


I've added an AI Agent chatbot from Jotform AI into the website for users to interact with to get help in stock market information and decision-making in the bottom right.
Also makes this website feel more like a personal dashboard that feels more home.
